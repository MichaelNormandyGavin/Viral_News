An analysis of news stories from November 2015 to July 2016 - dataset found on UCI website

For me, this is a relevant topic regarding Facebook and other social media platforms in the role of pushing and spreading news stories.

I would have liked to have tried my hand at sentiment analysis, but the dataset does not lend itself to a DIY approach in this regard.

First time implementing Dask delayed objects and dataframes as well as rudimentary webscraping.

I was not able to find a useful machine learning algorithm to predict popularity score.
